/*****************************************************************************
*
* NOTE1:
* QF, like all real-time frameworks, needs to execute certain sections of
* code indivisibly to avoid data corruption. The most straightforward way of
* protecting such critical sections of code is disabling and enabling
* interrupts, which POSIX does not allow.
*
* This QF port uses therefore a single package-scope p-thread mutex
* QF_pThreadMutex_ to protect all critical sections. The mutex is locked upon
* the entry to each critical sectioni and unlocked upon exit.
*
* Using the single mutex for all crtical section guarantees that only one
* thread at a time can execute inside a critical section. This prevents race
* conditions and data corruption.
*
* Please note, however, that the mutex implementation of a critical section
* behaves differently than the standard interrupt locking. A common mutex
* ensures that only one thread at a time can execute a critical section, but
* it does not guarantee that a context switch cannot occur within the
* critical section. In fact, such context switches probably will happen, but
* they should not cause concurrency hazards because the mutex eliminates all
* race conditionis.
*
* Unlinke simply disabling and enabling interrupts, the mutex approach is
* also subject to priority inversions. However, the p-thread mutex
* implementation, such as POSIX threads, should support the priority-
* inheritance protocol.
