About These Examples
====================
The examples for TI-RTOS kernel (SYS/BIOS) require separate
installation of the TI-RTOS on your machine (typically into
the directory C:\ti).

NOTE: The TI-RTOS is too big to fit into the 3rd_party directory
in the QP/C distribution. Also, TI-RTOS requires its own tooling
and build process (XDCTOOLS). Please refer to the TI Application
Note "TI-RTOS 2.16 for TivaC Getting Started Guide" (Literature
Number: SPRUHU5D) for more information.
